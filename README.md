# SE_Assignment_M2
In this assignment, we will explore a range of fundamental programming concepts. We will begin by examining basic logic and conditional programming, where we will use various control flow statements such as if-else, nested if-else, ladder else-if, and switch-case. We will also delve into looping constructs and their applications. Arrays will be a key focus, including single-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional arrays. Additionally, we will study functions and their usage, as well as string manipulation. Throughout the assignment, we will work with different data types, including int, char, float, and double, to understand their roles and applications in programming.
